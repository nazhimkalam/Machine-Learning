Q) What is Machine Learning?

* Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) which provides machines the ability to learn automatically & imporve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

* What basically happens is that we teach the machine to learn with some given set of data, therefore it can predict the value for the new data point.



Q) What are the TYPES of Machine Learning?

	1. Supervised Learning:- Teaching the machine to learn with guidance.

	2. Unsupervised Learning:- The machine learns different paths without guidance to find a proper solution.

	3. Reinforcement Learning:- It is the learning method where the machine interacts with the environment by producing actions and discovering errors.



Q) What is SVM (Support Vector Machine)?

* SVM is a supervised classification method that separates data using hyperplanes.



Q) What is a Hyper-Plane?

* Hyper Plane is a straight-line which seperates the 2 class.


## we always choose a HYPER PLANE that maximizes the margin between classes.


Q) How does SVM work?

* SVM classifies the data using a HYPER-PLANE.
* Support Vectors are the data point from each class which is closest to the Hyper-Plane.
* The distance between the support vectors and the Hyper plane is Maximum, in other words the margin (distance between the support vectors and the Hyper plane) has to be maximum

* The MAIN RULE is to create the HYPER-PLANE which has the greatest margin between the support vectors.



Q) What is a Non-Linear SVM?

* Non-linear SVM is used when the data can't be separated using a straight line. For this we view the data in a 3-D model structure and seperate the data.
