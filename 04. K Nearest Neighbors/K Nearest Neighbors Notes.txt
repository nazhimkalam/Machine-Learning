Q) What is KNN Algorithm?

* K Nearest Neighbour, is a simple alogrithm that stores all the available cases and classifies the new data or case based on a similarity measure.
* "IF YOU ARE SIMILAR TO YOUR NEIGHBOUR THEN YOU ARE ONE OF THEM"
	


Q) What is the "K" in KKN Alogrithm?

* K = "Number of Nearest Neighbour"
* It checks the closed K number of data points and classifies that particular data point.



Q) What are the industrial purposes of KNN alogrithm?

* Recommender System. (movie recommeder system, amazon shopping recommender system).
* Concept Search (Classifying Documents)



Q) How does a KNN Alogrithm work?

* The KNN alogrithm entirely depends the value of K.
* It checks the K number of data points which is close to the new data point.
* The new data point falls into the category where the most data points are found in that particular range of K.
* When the value of K changes then the category of the new data point may also change dependently.



Q) How to choose the value of K in KNN algorithm?

* Use cross-validation technique to test serveral values of K, in order to determine which works best for your data.



Q) How things are predicted using KNN Algorithm?

* Calculating the Euclidean Distance.
* Calculating the Manhattan Distance.


# Now if we have a new DATA to be classified to we can calculate the Euclidean Distance and Manhattan Distance and use the number of K and solve.
