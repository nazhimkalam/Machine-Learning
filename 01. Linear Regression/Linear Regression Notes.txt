* Linear Regression is a type of Regression Algorithm.


Q) What is Regression?

* Regression analaysis is a form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between a "dependent"(Y axis) and "independent variable"(X axis).


Q) What are the uses of Regression Analysis?

* Determining the strength of the predicators.	 eg:- what is the strength between sales and income, in this case (sales and income are the predicators)
* Forecasting an effect. 	eg:- Examining the change in one variable when the other one changes
* Trend Forecasting. 	eg:- Examining the change of a variable in future



# There are various types of regression but in Machine Learning we will be working on "Linear Regression" and "Logistic Regression".

Q) What are the features of Linear Regression?

* Maps a continuous X to continuous Y.
* The data is modelled using a "Straight Line".
* Uses Continuous Variables.
* The value of the variable is considered as the output.
* The Accuracy is measured by:   
	--> Measured of loss.
	--> R squared.
	--> Adjusted R squared.


Q) Where is Linear Regression used?

* Evaluating Trends and Sales Estimates.
* Analyzing the Impact of Price Changes.
* Assessment of risk in financial services and insurance domain.

# we should always reduce the distance (ERROR) between the actual value and the predicted value
# The line with the least error will be the 'Regression Line'



Q) How to check the Accuracy of the Regression Line?

--> Using R squared method
* R-squared value is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line.
* It is also known as "coefficient of determination" or the "coefficient of multiple determination".
* In genreal higher R-square value means the regression line is more accurate.
