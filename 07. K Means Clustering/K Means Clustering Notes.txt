Q) What is Clustering?

* Clustering is the process of dividing the datasets into groups, consisting of similar data-points.

* Points in the same group are as similar as possible.

* Points in different group are as dissimilar as possible.

	eg:- 	-> Group of diners in a restaurant.
		   Diners in the same table are similar
		   Diners from one table to another are not similar

		-> Items arranged in a mall.
		   You won't find fruits in vegetables section and vice versa.



Q) Where is clustering used?

* Amazon recommendation system
* NetFlix recommendation system



Q) How business use Clustering?

* Retail Store
* Banking
* Insurance Companies



Q) What are the types of Clustering?

	1. Exclusive Clustering:-

		* Hard Clustering
		* Data points/Items belong exclusively to one cluster
			eg:- K-Means Clustering
 

	2. Overlapping Clustering:-

		* Soft Clustering
		* Data points/Items belong to multiple cluster
			eg:- C-Means Clustering


	3. Hierarchical Clustering.



Q) What is K-Means Clustering?

* K-Means is a clustering algorithm whose main goal is to group similar elements or data points into a cluster.

* The "K" in the K-Means represents the number of clusters.



## According to the K-Means Algorithm it iterates over again and again unless and until the data points within each cluster stops changing.

## The overall goal is to divide data into distinct groups such that obervations within each group are similar.

## Choose a number of clusters "K"
## Randomly assign each point to a cluster
## Until cluster stop changing, repeat the following:
##	For each cluster, compute the cluster centroid by taking the mean vector points in the cluster.
##	Assign each data point to the cluster for which the centroid is the closest.
