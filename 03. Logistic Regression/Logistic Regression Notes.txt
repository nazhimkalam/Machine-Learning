Q) What is Logistic Regression?

* This produces results in a binary format (1 or 0), which is used to predict the outcome of a categorical dependent variable. 
* Note that the outcome is  discrete/categorical such as:
	eg:- 0 or 1
	     Yes or No
	     True or False
 	     High or Low




# Logistic Regression Curve is also known at the Sigmoid Curve (S curve)
# The Thershold value indicates the probability of winning or losing, in other words meaning that in which category will the value fall into,
(0 or 1), (Yes or No), (True or False).



Q) What are the features of Logistic regression?

* Uses Categorical Variables.
* Solves Classification Problems.
* S-Curve



Q) Use cases of Logistic Regression?

* We can predict the Weather using Logistic Regression, but we can predict the temperature using Linear Regression
	eg:- will it rain or not       <--- Logistic Regression
	     26 deg, 32 deg, -16 deg   <--- Linear Regression

* Determining illness. 
	eg:- Sick or not
